# Shordle

Like wordle, but on bash. The dictionary is in `words.txt`, and the executable is `shordle.sh`.
The shell file can be run by typing `sh shordle.sh` or modifying `shordle.sh` as an executable
by running `chmod +x shordle.sh`.

Every time you start a game, a random word will be chosen from the dictionary. This can be any word,
even one that neither you or I have heard of. The only constraint is that the word is going to be
exactly 5 letters. Good luck!
